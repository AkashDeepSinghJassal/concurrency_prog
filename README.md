# Concurrency and Multi-threading Solutions

This repository contains examples and solutions for various concurrency and multi-threading programming problems.

## Overview

Concurrent programming involves multiple threads of execution running simultaneously, allowing programs to:
- Make better use of multiple CPU cores
- Keep the UI responsive while performing background operations
- Improve throughput for I/O-bound operations

## Common Synchronization Mechanisms

- **Locks/Mutexes**: Prevent multiple threads from accessing shared resources simultaneously
- **Semaphores**: Control access to a limited number of resources
- **Condition Variables**: Allow threads to wait until a particular condition occurs
- **Atomic Operations**: Perform operations that cannot be interrupted by other threads


## Examples

This repository includes implementations of common concurrency patterns:
- Producer-Consumer problem
- Readers-Writers problem

## Getting Started

Check out the examples directory to see implementations in various programming languages.
